/*
 * ListRow and RowButton.
 *
 * A row of a list, one thing said in a line: ListRow for a fact, RowButton for
 * a choice.
 *
 * Every screen of every product has a list of something - versions, releases,
 * a queue, a journal - and each drew its own row: kilna alone had six
 * list-and-detail layouts with five different row recipes, and the selected
 * row was tinted four different ways. The row is three slots and a rule
 * about truncation, which is small enough to get wrong every time and
 * exactly why it is here.
 *
 * Two components, because a row is either a fact or a choice:
 *
 * - `ListRow` is a fact - "Clip, 02.09" in a list of releases. It is not
 *   pressable, has no hover, and rows in a run are divided by a hairline.
 * - `RowButton` is a choice - a version in the list beside the editor, an
 *   item in a queue. It is a real `<button>` (or the product's link, through
 *   `render`), it answers the pointer, and the one that is open is tinted on
 *   `accent-soft` - the mockup's `.vrow.on` - and named as current, because
 *   the tint alone says it to nobody who cannot see it.
 *
 * The slots are the same in both: `start` for the thing that identifies the
 * row at a glance (an icon, a status dot, a cover), the row's words with an
 * optional `description` under them, and `end` for what is measured about it
 * (a date, a count, a chip). The words truncate on one line and the slots do
 * not shrink: a list whose rows grow to two lines in one language and not in
 * the other stops being a list you can scan.
