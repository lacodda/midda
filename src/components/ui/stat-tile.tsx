/*
 * One figure, and what it is a figure of.
 *
 * The smallest thing on a dashboard and the one every product writes itself:
 * a label above, a number below, sometimes a word about which way it moved.
 * It is here because the first consumer had written it twice - once on the
 * personal page, once on the team one - and the copies had already drifted:
 * one had grown a warning tone the other lacked, and the tone classes in it
 * were concatenated without a space, so a figure that was both accented and
 * warning would have emitted `text-accent-2text-warn` and been styled by
 * neither. Nothing had gone wrong on screen yet; the two flags were simply
 * never passed together.
 *
 * A `<dl>` rather than two divs, for the reason KeyValue is one: the pairing
 * is what a screen reader announces. Loose divs read as two unrelated pieces
 * of text and nothing says the number belongs to the label.
 *
 * Numbers are set in the mono face with tabular figures, so a column of tiles
 * lines up and a value that ticks does not shuffle its neighbours sideways.
 * That matters more than it sounds: a live figure redrawn every few seconds in
 * proportional digits makes the whole row twitch.
 *
 * The delta is a second, quieter line rather than a colour on the value. A
 * number that turns red is a number whose colour has to be explained, and the
 * explanation is never on the screen; a delta says "+12% vs last week" and
 * needs nothing. Its tone is stated by the caller rather than inferred from
 * the sign, because down is good for a figure like "time to first response",
 * and a component cannot know which figure it is holding.

 * A tone that is a judgement has to bring a mark with it.
 *
 * `warn` and `bad` say this figure is a problem, and on a dashboard that claim
 * is carried by colour alone - which is exactly where it fails. The line's own
 * accents sit close to the status hues: measured in OKLab, the first
 * consumer's gold is Delta-E 3.7 from `--warn`, hilvan's is 2.5 from `--bad`,
 * and four more products are inside 8.3. One tile accented and another warning
 * are, to a reader glancing down a row, the same colour.
 *
 * Neither side can move. The status hues are the line's shared language and
 * the accents come from the brand registry, so the fix is the rule the theme
 * already states in prose: meaning never rests on colour alone. Here it is
 * structure instead - the type will not let a judgement be drawn without a
 * mark beside it.
 *
 * The first consumer had already worked this out by hand, wrapping its value
 * in a flex row with a warning triangle. That is the proof the requirement is
 * real, and the reason it belongs in the primitive rather than in a guideline
 * nobody reads twice.
