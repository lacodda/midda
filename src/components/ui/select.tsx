/*
 * Select.
 *
 * The component the oldest rule in the line is about. A native `<select>`
 * cannot be dressed: the browser draws its popup itself, in the operating
 * system's chrome, and no CSS reaches inside. One native dropdown on a screen
 * of the product's own controls reads as a foreign object, and on Windows it
 * reads as a foreign object from 1998.
 *
 * So this renders `<button role="combobox">` and a portalled list of
 * `role="option"` - zero native elements, which is asserted in the test,
 * because it is the entire reason the component exists.
 *
 * What that costs is everything the browser was doing for free: the keyboard,
 * type-ahead, the announcement of the selected value, the scroll into view,
 * and on a phone the whole native picker. Base UI does all of it, which is
 * the only reason this trade is worth making - a hand-rolled dropdown is how
 * a product ships a control that a screen reader cannot see.
 *
 * The trigger wears Input's `fieldClasses`, imported rather than copied. A
 * select and a text field sit next to each other in every form there has ever
 * been, and two class lists that started the same drift within a release.
 *
 * `multiple` is a prop on the Root: it changes what `value` means - an array
 * rather than a single value - so it belongs where the value lives and not on
 * the trigger.
